## 🧠 The Co-Pilot Workflow
This project was developed through a strategic partnership between 
**Lead Engineer Vanjunn Pongasi** and **Gemini (AI Co-Pilot)**, 
demonstrating the efficiency of AI-augmented engineering in 2026.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture
- **Data Integrity**: Automated health checks via `src/check_data.py`.
- **Infrastructure**: Containerized environment using **Docker** and **Docker-Compose**.
- **Orchestration**: Seamless pipeline triggers using custom Batch and Python scripts.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Tailored VRAM and CPU management for RX 580 / i5-12400f.

## 📈 Current Status: PHASE 1 COMPLETE
- [x] Professional D: Drive folder hierarchy established.
- [x] Cloud Handshake: GitHub repository fully synced.
- [x] The Guard: Implemented automated data validation logic.
